Last anyone\r\n&quot; &quot;heard, he was visiting locations that are historically\r\n&quot; &quot;significant to the North Pole; a group of Senior Historians has\r\n&quot; &quot;asked you to accompany them as they check the places they think\r\n&quot; &quot;he was most likely to visit.\r\n&quot; &quot;\r\n&quot; &quot;As each location is checked, they will mark it on their list\r\n&quot; &quot;with a star. They figure the Chief Historian must be in one\r\n&quot; &quot;of the first fifty places they&apos;ll look, so in order to save\r\n&quot; &quot;Christmas, you need to help them get fifty stars on their list\r\n&quot; &quot;before Santa takes off on December 25th.\r\n&quot; &quot;\r\n&quot; &quot;Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made\r\n&quot; &quot;available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second\r\n&quot; &quot;puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle\r\n&quot; &quot;grants one star. Good luck!\r\n&quot; &quot;\r\n&quot; &quot;You haven&apos;t even left yet and the group of Elvish Senior\r\n&quot; &quot;Historians has already hit a problem: their list of locations\r\n&quot; &quot;to check is currently empty. Eventually, someone decides that\r\n&quot; &quot;the best place to check first would be the Chief\r\n&quot; &quot;Historian&apos;s office.\r\n&quot; &quot;\r\n&quot; &quot;Upon pouring into the office, everyone confirms that the\r\n&quot; &quot;Chief Historian is indeed nowhere to be found. Instead, the\r\n&quot; &quot;Elves discover an assortment of notes and lists of historically\r\n&quot; &quot;significant locations! This seems to be the planning the \r\n&quot; &quot;Chief Historian was doing before he left. Perhaps these\r\n&quot; &quot;notes can be used to determine which locations to search?\r\n&quot; &quot;\r\n&quot; &quot;Throughout the Chief&apos;s office, the historically significant\r\n&quot; &quot;locations are listed not by name but by a unique number called\r\n&quot; &quot;the location ID. To make sure they don&apos;t miss anything,\r\n&quot; &quot;The Historians split into two groups, each searching the office \r\n&quot; &quot;and trying to create their own complete list of location IDs.\r\n&quot; &quot;\r\n&quot; &quot;There&apos;s just one problem: by holding the two lists up side\r\n&quot; &quot;by side (your puzzle input), it quickly becomes clear that \r\n&quot; &quot;the lists aren&apos;t very similar.
